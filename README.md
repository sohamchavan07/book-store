## Development logins

For local development and testing you can use these accounts (development database):

- Email: `soham@gmail.com`
	- Password: `Password123!`

- Email: `test@example.com`
	- Password: `TestPassword123!`

These credentials are for development only. Do NOT use them in production and rotate/remove them before sharing or deploying the database.
